Corner Grocer Program

Author: Leonardo Figueroa
Language: C++

Project Summary

The Corner Grocer program was built in hopes of helping a local grocery store analyze customer purchases. It reads a text file with a list of items bought throughout the day and counts how many times each item appears. The program then lets the user view item frequencies, search for a specific item, and display a histogram showing the results. This helps the store organize its layout and understand which products are most popular.

What I Did Well

I did well at organizing my code using a class structure and keeping it easy to read. Using a map to store item frequencies made the program efficient and clean. I also made sure to comment my code and name everything clearly so it’s easy to follow.


What I Could Improve

If I had more time, I’d add better input validation and error handling. Right now, the program assumes the input file is always available and that users type valid item names. Adding checks for missing files or typos would make the program more secure and user friendly.


Most Challenging Part

The hardest part for me was figuring out how to properly read and write files in C++. I had issues at first with file paths and getting the program to find the text file, but I fixed it by testing different locations and using relative file paths. I also used zyBooks and class examples to understand how file streams work.


Transferable Skills

Through this project, I strengthened my C++ programming skills, particularly in object oriented programming, maps, loops, and file input/output. These skills transfer well to other programming projects or languages since they’re part of core software development.

Maintainability and Readability

I focused on keeping the code simple, readable, and modular. I used clear variable names, commented each function, and employed a class based design. This makes it easy for another programmer to update or expand the project in the future.

Reflection

This project helped me understand how small, practical programs can be used to solve real business problems. It also showed me the importance of clean code and documentation. I’m proud of how the Corner Grocer project turned out and would definitely build on it by adding a graphical interface or database support later on.
